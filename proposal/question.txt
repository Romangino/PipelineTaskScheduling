Most modern biology experiments are data-driven. Bioinformatics, for example, uses pipelines to process raw sequencing data into a usable format. If, however, the sequencing data is processed in the wrong order, it may take an unnecessarily substantial amount of time to get through all of it. The premise of our experiment revolves around the efficient scheduling of tasks, particularly with limited resources such as CPU and RAM. We will analyze methods historically used in bioinformatics pipelines for efficiently scheduling tasks. We will also research more novel approaches to scheduling in the context of bioinformatics and compare these with the established methods.
