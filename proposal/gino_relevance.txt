Before starting my studies at Northeastern I had worked in different areas of chemistry focusing on research. While working in these labs there were many experiments that needed to be analyzed or performed on large computer systems. These systems, although quite powerful, needed long periods of time to complete such analysis and many times samples needed to be processed through multiple tests to retrieve usable clear data. For example, when I was in my undergraduate studies, I worked in an organic research lab. We would have samples that needed analysis using NMR. These samples would need to have multiple scans, some longer than others, to be able to verify the compound and its purity. Since other researchers at the university also needed to run tests on their samples this would cause a tremendous backlog meaning researchers might not get the data they need in a timely manner. This is not ideal since retrieving this data would be able to help researchers progress their research. In this project weâ€™ll be looking at how genetic algorithms could optimize job scheduling within biology, but this type of solution could also be beneficial to any group that needs to optimize job scheduling. Having an algorithm that will help not only speed up the time needed for analysis but also help save resources allowing researchers to extend their projects.
