The "Scheduling Problem," as it has been popularly coined, is relevant to many academic fields. Perhaps no field reliant on the scheduling problem, however, is as vital to humanity's well-being as bioinformatics. Genomics is a particularly well-known subfield of bioinformatics responsible for identifying genes causing a multitude of diseases. Proteomics, similarly, is responsible for identifying proteins (and their potential errors) that cause diseases. Both subfields, among others, use efficient solutions to the scheduling problem to add tasks to pipelines in (near) optimal ways. This, naturally, allows scientists to determine the causes of diseases more quickly in hopes that a cure can be developed. I, for one, am absolutely terrified of cancer. It is one of those diseases that, even with no family history, can seemingly randomly appear and spread undetected until it is too late. The scheduling problem in the context of bioinformatics is relevant to be because learning about how the processes of discovering diseases and sequencing genes gives me comfort that we will one day find a cure for diseases like cancer. Understanding how jobs are scheduled efficiently in a way puts my mind at ease; knowing that scientists are going as fast as possible with the current technology is reassuring.
