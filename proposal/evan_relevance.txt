The "Scheduling Problem," as it has been popularly coined, is relevant to many academic fields. Perhaps no field reliant on the scheduling problem, however, is as vital to humanity's well-being as bioinformatics. Genomics is a particularly well-known subfield of bioinformatics responsible for identifying genes causing a multitude of diseases. Proteomics, similarly, is responsible for identifying proteins (and their potential errors) that cause diseases. Both subfields, among others, use efficient solutions to the scheduling problem to add tasks to pipelines in (near) optimal ways. This, naturally, allows scientists to determine the causes of diseases more quickly in hopes that a cure can be developed. I, for one, am absolutely terrified of cancer. It is one of those diseases that, even with no family history, can seemingly randomly appear and spread undetected until it is too late. The scheduling problem in the context of bioinformatics is relevant to me because it puts my mind at ease knowing that, with our current technology, scientists are working as quickly as possible to develop cures for such horrible diseases like cancer. The efficient scheduling of jobs is only one component to being able to develop cures quickly, but it is vital that we reduce as much as possible any bottleneck associated associated with job scheduling for the sake of improving the efficiency of the overall process.
