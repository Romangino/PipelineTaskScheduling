Given the timeframe of this project, we will focus on two main subjects. The first is researching the established method(s) for scheduling jobs in a bioinformatics pipeline. This will involve searching for and analyzing any open-source code, reading scientific papers on the topic, and potentially implementing small-scale examples. Our second focus is on researching newer/experimental ways of scheduling, such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing. If time permits, we will further explore how CPU and RAM limitations affect scheduling in the pipeline.
